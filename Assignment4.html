<!--
Part 1
Using JavaScript and HTML 5, write a program that computes an employee's salary. Prompt the user for the number of hours worked and the type of employee (1 -- Tester, 2 -- Developer, 3 -- Manager).
The pay rate for a Tester is $35/hour, for a Developer is $50/hour, and for a Manager is $65/hour. Compute the salary of the employee. Display the employee’s salary on your webpage.

Part 2
Modify part 1 to account for overtime pay. If an employee works for more than 40 hours, then he/she gets paid 1.5 times the hourly pay rate for the extra hours. For example,
if Alice works 50 hours in a week and her hourly pay rate is $65/hour then she gets paid 65 * 40 + 65 * 1.5 * (50 – 40).

Part 3
Using HTML 5 and Javascript, build a web page that allows customers to book rental cars. Customers pick a car type (Compact, Intermediate, Standard) using a drop down list,
enter the number of days using a text box and select if they want to buy Insurance or not using radio buttons. Compact cars cost $30 / day, Intermediate cars cost $40 / day and Standard cars cost $50 / day.
 Insurance costs $15 / day for all car types. Your web page should compute and display the total cost of renting the car.

Part 4
Sarah Anderson owns an image consulting shop. Her clients can select from the following services at the specified regular prices: Makeover $125, Hair Styling $60, Manicure $35, and Permanent Makeup $200.
She has distributed discount coupons that advertise discounts of 10 percent and 20 percent off the regular price. Create a webpage using HTML 5 and Javascript that will allow the receptionist to select a
discount rate of 10 percent, 20 percent, or none, and then select a service. Use drop down list for discount and service. Clicking the Calculate button should display the total due.
